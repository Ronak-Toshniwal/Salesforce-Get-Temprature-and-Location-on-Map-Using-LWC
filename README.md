Hello All
In this project I have Used LWC to make 2 new component on Record Page 

2 Components added (Using Wire Adapter)
1) Get Marker on Lightning Map based on Billing Address entered.
2) Get Temprature Based on Billing City and Print Temprature in Celcius.

Future Plans 
Upgrade UI Of Temprature Widget.
